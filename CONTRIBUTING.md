## What should I know before I get started?

#### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to our [code of conduct](./CodeOfConduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to one of the organizers.

## How Can I Contribute?

#### For example
- reporting bugs of existing code and files
- suggesting enhancements on existing code or organizational elements
- bringing up new ideas regarding the goal of our repo
- add your mob programming ideas
- improve our mob programming code

#### How?
- All sorts of contributions will be managed as an [issue](https://github.com/FCCVienna/FCCVienna/issues) in our repo - always start from here
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
- When you have already written changes: Push your local branch to the repo and open a [Pull Request](http://makeapullrequest.com/). (Add the organizers as Reviewers)

#### Pull Requests
- Pull requests always have to be reviewed by at least 2 organizers.
- Describe your changes precisely in a comment.
- When possible classify the pull request in the corresponding project, milestone and label.
- When chosen reviewers fail to review the changes, organizers are allowed to merge in order to maintain workflow of the project.

## Styleguides

#### Git Commit Messages

Your commit messages should serve these 3 important purposes:

- To speed up the reviewing process.
- To provide the least amount of necessary documentation
- To help the future maintainers.
