# BASH

# Man

man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.

```
man bash
man git
```

---

# Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

```
git init
git clone
git status
git add
git commit -m 'Commit message'
git push
```

---

# Navigate And Find Files

With the command line you're never far away from finding your files.

```
cd mydir/hello
cd ..
cd ../../..
find / -name catpic
find . -name catpic
ack
```

---

# Creating Files And Directories

It's easy to create files from the command line.

```
touch file_1.txt
echo "hello textfile" > file_2.txt
nano file_3.txt
echo "more hello" >> file_2.txt
vim file_3.txt
```

---

# Manipulating Files

You can easily remove, update timestamp, and change the content of files.

```
touch -d "2 hours ago" file_1.txt
rm file_1.txt
echo "more content" >> file_2.txt
nano file_2.txt
```

---

# Vim

```
vim myfile.txt
ESC
:wq!
```

---

# Connect To A Server

```
ssh root@1.2.3.4
tmux
vim
ctrl+a d
```

---

# Process Management

```
pidof program
kill 9378
pkill program

htop
```

---

# Nyancat
