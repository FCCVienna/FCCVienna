# Introduction

This talk is by no means exhaustive.  

It's meant to give people unfamiliar (or only a little bit familiar) with the command line, a little jump-start.  

Suggestions for talk improvements, or additional commands that should be included, are welcome!

# Unix

This talk is Unix and Bash centric.  

Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs.  

The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development. It is based on the experience of leading developers of the Unix operating system. Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a "software tools" movement.

# Bash

Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989, it has been distributed widely as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple's macOS.

```
Ctrl+r
Ctrl+a
Ctrl+e
Ctrl+l
clear
```

# Man

man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.

```
man bash
man git
```

---

# Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

```
git init
git clone
git status
git add
git commit -m 'Commit message'
git push
```

---

# Creating Files And Directories

It's easy to create files from the command line.

```
touch file_1.txt
echo "hello textfile" > file_2.txt
nano file_3.txt
echo "more hello" >> file_2.txt
vim file_3.txt
mkdir mydir
mkdir -p mydir/hello
```

---

# Navigate And Find Files

With the command line you're never far away from finding your files.

```
ls
ls -lah
cd mydir/hello
cd ..
cd ../..
find / -name catpic
find . -name catpic
ack
```

---

# Manipulating Files

You can easily remove, update timestamp, and change the content of files.

```
touch -d "2 hours ago" file_1.txt
rm file_1.txt
echo "more content" >> file_2.txt
nano file_2.txt
mv file_2.txt file_newname.txt
cp file_2.txt file_3.txt
cp file_2.txt{,.bkp}
```

---

# Vim

```
vim myfile.txt
ESC
:help vimtutor
:wq!
```

---

# Connect To A Server

```
ssh root@1.2.3.4
tmux
vim
ctrl+b d
tmux attach
tmux ls
tmux attach -t 0
```

---

# Process Management

```
pidof program
kill 9378
pkill program
top
htop
```

---

# Nyancat

```
sudo apt install nyancat
nyancat
```
