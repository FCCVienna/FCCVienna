## Plans For 2019

We're planning to make some changes this year. We love organizing and hosting meetups with talks, but at times it demands a lot of work for us organizers, especially if we have to give talks on every meetup.

This, combined with the fact that Fridays won't work too well for Robert this semester, has lead us to reassess the format of the freeCodeCamp Vienna meetups.

We've decided to keep having monthly meetups, but on Saturday evenings, and in a cafe or bar, without talks. Aka "Code and Drinks".
